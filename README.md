# Sudoku

## What I've done
I've made the game of Sudoku in ***Python***, using ***Pygame***. The game is playable, you can add and remove numbers. There is also an autocomplete functionality.

## What I hope to implement
Some simple UI changes, and maybe a timer and a mistake counter.

## Resources
### Modules
* Pygame
